    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
      üåÄ DizzySense ("the App", "we", "our") is a mobile application designed to
      help users understand possible causes of dizziness and guide them toward
      appropriate medical specialists. We value your privacy and do not collect
      any personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>üîç Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>Location or device identifiers</li>
      <li>Health records or medical history</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The app runs entirely on your device and does not transmit any quiz
      responses or data to our servers or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>üì± Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      DizzySense does not request access to your camera, contacts, location, or
      microphone. It only uses basic device functions necessary to run the app
      smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>üíº Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking tools
      (such as Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The app may open external websites (e.g., Google Search) for convenience.
      These are handled by your device's browser, and DizzySense does not
      transmit any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>üîê Data Security</h2>
    <p>

      or transmit. All symptom selections and quiz logic occur entirely on your
      device.
    </p>

    <h2>üë∂ Children's Privacy</h2>
